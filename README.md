## About

I design and deploy advanced systems for ecological regeneration, decentralized autonomy, and AI-integrated infrastructure.  
My work focuses on scalable solutions to planetary challenges, including wildfire mitigation, carbon capture, emotional transformation, energy decentralization, and post-collapse resilience.

All code and systems in this repository are designed to remain open-source, mission-aligned, and zero-cost to deploy. Commercial resale is not permitted.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Planetary Restoration Frameworks**  
  Tools and protocols to regenerate ecosystems, mitigate climate threats, and enable decentralized land healing.

- **AI-Orchestrated Infrastructure**  
  Multi-agent systems for smart deployment of drones, filters, sensors, and energy systems.

- **Regenerative Building Technologies**  
  Passive air filtration, solar-integrated systems, and modular ecological upgrades for existing structures.

- **Decentralized Emotional Systems**  
  Gamified mental health systems and emotional intelligence engines for individuals and communities.

## Featured Projects

### 🔬 [MycoThermSeed™](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster/MycoThermSeed)
A thermophilic fungal filtration system that captures industrial emissions, stores excess heat, and enables self-seeding biofilter regeneration.

### 🌍 [Geo-Ecological Resonant Engineering (GERE)](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster/Geo-Ecological-Resonant-Engineering-GERE)  
A planetary-scale initiative leveraging natural resonance fields, ecological feedback loops, and decentralized architecture to restore environmental coherence.

### 🧱 [Lightforge](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster/Lightforge)  
A modular, gamified system for emotional recovery and behavior transformation. Designed for use in schools, communities, and peer support networks.

### 🌫️ [EcoDraft + SkyWeave™](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster/EcoDraft)  
Passive atmospheric purification and smart roofing systems designed to transform buildings into climate-resilient, energy-generating nodes.

### 🎮 [Project LOOPFALL](https://github.com/TheRickyFoster/Project-LOOPFALL)  
A narrative reengineering engine that integrates with digital platforms (e.g., Fortnite) to embed subtle myth reframing, promoting cooperation, clarity, and long-term thinking.
